% GLM READ ME
% Start with GLM_ExDat. This is the most up to date version of the code.
% Future updates will be kept in a "versions in progress" folder until
% they are ready to replace teh current GLM_ExDAT.

% The script will prompt you to open an Ops file. They can be found in
% 'D:\Analysis Code\Calcium-Imaging-Analysis\modeling_analysis\matlab_GLMs\TAK Lab GLM\GLM event ops files'
% As of today (10/26/23) there is only one Ops file. Please open it, and
% use the 'save as' feature to make your own version. 

% If anything is unclear or you suspect that something is incorrect, please
% contact Carolyn ASAP. This analysis is an ongoing work in progress, and
% as such, it is prone to an occasional bug.

% If there is a feature that you think will be useful for the lab, we can
% work on adding it.
